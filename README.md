# cs451-practicals
Practical Assignments (just starter code) for CS451: Machine Learning

## To Fork or not to fork?

I am not bothered if you fork and push your solutions to github; none of these practicals are supposed to be overly complex.

## Opening in repl.it

The repl.it link to this repo is here:
https://repl.it/@jjfoley/cs451-practicals

... although you may want to fork it first on github, and open your version of the repo. Every class you can merge from upstream to get the new practicals, or just copy the file in.

## Setting up a virtualenv: (MacOS / \*nix)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Setting up in vscode

I recommend the following plugins:
  - Python
  - Pyright (static type checker for python)
  - Error Lens (the one with the most stars: ``usernamehw.errorlens``)
